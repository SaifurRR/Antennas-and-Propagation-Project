# Antennas-and-Propagation-Project

WPT uses Electro-magnetic wave energy to transfer energy from a power source (transmitters) to load (receiver) wirelessly. The system that incorporates this process is termed as WPT. This particular research area holds a wide range of applications, which includes areas in smartphone technology, electric vehicle, wireless sensor network, medical implants, etc. The motivation of this project was brought about by the work of Dr. Loic Markley in his paper titled, 'Idle Power Loss Suppression in Magnetic Resonance Coupling Wireless Power Transfer'. In the literature it was shown that power loss can be minimized when operating in an idle state, while maintaining high transmission efficiency when operating in active state. The particular research also showed that maximum power can be transferred between the transmitter and receiver coils under conjugate matching. This project outlines a proof of concept of WPT using AWR as a simulation tool. A simplistic model for near-field coupling was used to demonstrate the process. A comparative analysis between Dipole & Loop antenna was also made, to justify which combinations as a transmitter and receiver unit yields a better Electro-coupling response.
